3) Create a script that find the 500th prime number 

4) Create a script that reads mazes from a file. The maze starts in the position that contains '*'. The walls of the maze are defined with '0' and paths with '1'. 
Your script must find the prize defined with '$' and replace the path that found the destination with '2'. See file 'maze_result' for example. If maze doesn't have a valid prize, the result file must say: "Maze doesn't have prize or valid prize"
