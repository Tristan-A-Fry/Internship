Exercise #1 - Create a Program file for each problem

1) Create a script data uses the mock data found in ProductData.cs file. Using LINQ methods, the script must output the following:
	- List the total cost per category
	- Find the product with the highest price per category
	- Sort the categories based on the sum of the product's total cost

2) Create a script data uses the mock data found in ProductData.cs file. The script must create an output file using the product data with the following format:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-----     Name     -----     Category     -----     Price     ------
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	 PlayStation 5		Electronics				$599.9


Note: The column's width must be adaptive based on the product data to create the desired output

3) Create a script that prompt users to input the platform's area and block number to search BOEM's database. 
If there are any platform, you must display the platform's area code, block number, field, structure and Busc Asc Name.
The platform's data is stored in a zip file. The zip contains a file called 'mv_platstruc_structures':
	- https://www.data.boem.gov/Platform/Files/PlatStrucRawData.zip

The file format is found in the following link:
	- https://www.data.boem.gov/Platform/PlatformStructures/FieldDefinitions.aspx

Note: Your script must be able to have the data downloaded and ready before prompting user's input. You can view BOEM platform online query web page in the following link:
